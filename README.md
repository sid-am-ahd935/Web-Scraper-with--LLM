# Another project in To-Do
Discontinuing work on this project. This project was started as an attempt to complete Taiyo's Assessment but unfortunately it is being discontinued due to several factors:
- The assessment asked for using LLM to produce smart scraping (scrape the website without changing source code even if website's HTML changes or the website itself)
- As of now, even after thorough research, there was no **free** LLM found that can pin point the selector for extraction from the website

Please note, this project may/may not be continued. Updates will be posted as they become available.
